## Project Overview

This project encompasses a full cycle of data handling, model development, and deployment, leveraging Azure's cloud capabilities to enhance predictive accuracy and operational efficiency.

## Data Handling and Initial Analysis

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleansing and structuring of dataset for optimal analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identification of key predictors and understanding data patterns to set the stage for effective feature engineering.
  
## Feature Engineering

Development of new features from existing data to improve the model's predictive accuracy regarding potential loan defaults.

## Model Development and Selection

* **Experimentation:** Tested various models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
* **Model Selection:** Chose the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
## Application Development and Modular Programming

Implemented modular programming to enhance maintainability and scalability of the application.

Developed a Flask web application for real-time data input and prediction output.

## Deployment on Azure

* **Containerization:** Utilized Docker to create a consistent deployment environment.
* **Azure Container Registry:** Stored and managed Docker images.
* **Continuous Deployment:** Integrated with GitHub Actions for automated updates and deployment via Azure Web Apps.
  
## Key Features

* **Real-Time Predictions:** Users can input data and receive predictions instantly.
* **High Accuracy and Precision:** Ensures reliable predictions to assist financial decision-making.
* **Scalable Infrastructure:** Built on Azure to efficiently handle increasing data and usage scales.
  
## Technologies Used
